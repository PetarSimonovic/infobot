# Examples for Scroll HAT Mini

Scroll HAT Mini includes four tactile push buttons connected to GPIO pins 5, 6, 16 and 24.

These examples demonstrate the use of the buttons, and combining them with display output for interesting results.

You can use these with the original Scroll pHAT HD, but you'll need to add buttons to these GPIO pins somehow!
